				<h2 class="pb-1"><b>Cancellation Policy - If you wish to make any changes to your order or cancel your order in its entirety, please inform Clicks Creative no later than 12 hours after your order is confirmed</b></h2>
				<p class="text-justify">At Clicks Creative, we understand and acknowledge the fact that people sometimes have second thoughts about their online purchases.  We also appreciate that where digital marketing is concerned, you may need a little extra time to decide the best way forward.</p>
				<p class="text-justify">That’s why we offer a flexible cancellation policy on all products and services provided by Clicks Creative.  After placing your order, you’ll have a 12-hour cooling-off period during which you can cancel or amend your order at any time, without incurring any penalties.</p>

				<p class="text-justify">Please note that after this time, the delivery of your order will commence, and you will no longer be eligible for a refund.  If you have any questions or concerns regarding your order during this time, be sure to contact a member of the team at Clicks Creative at your earliest convenience.</p>
				
				<h2 class="pb-1"><b>Subsequent Refund Requests</b></h2>
				<p class="text-justify">Refund requests received after this initial 12-hour cooling-off will only be considered in instances where Clicks Creative has been unable to provide the products and services requested by the customer, in accordance with the agreed purchase.</p>
				<p class="text-justify">In the unlikely event that we are unable to deliver the products and services you require, you will be entitled to a full refund of the original purchase price.</p>
